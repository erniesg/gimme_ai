# gimme_ai Enhancement Specifications

**IMPORTANT**: These files are **reference implementations** for architectural guidance only.

The next developer should use these as examples while implementing the production-ready version within the actual gimme_ai codebase structure.

## Files Overview

- `generic_api_workflow.ts` - Core Cloudflare Workers workflow engine architecture
- `yaml_config_parser.py` - YAML configuration parsing with Jinja2 templating
- `singapore_timezone_scheduler.py` - Singapore timezone conversion utilities
- `test_*.py` - Test suites demonstrating validation patterns

## Code Quality Notes

These reference files may not pass all linting rules as they prioritize architectural clarity over strict code standards. Production implementation should follow proper coding standards.

## Next Steps

1. Review `GIMME_AI_ENHANCEMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md` for complete specifications
2. Use these files as architectural reference
3. Implement production version in gimme_ai repository structure
4. Follow TDD approach with proper testing
